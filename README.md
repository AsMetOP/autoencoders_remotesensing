This repository provides code and supplementary materials for the paper entitled 'Remote sensing framework for lithological mapping via stacked autoencoders and clustering'. 

This paper proposes a framework based on different dimensionality reduction methods, including principal component analysis, canonical autoencoders, stacked autoencoders, and the k-means clustering algorithm to generate clustered maps using multispectral remote sensing data which are interpreted as lithological maps.

## Dataset
This framework is applied to three different data types, including are in `/datasets/main_dataset.zip` folder or can be download from the source attached below.
A small dataset also included in the `datasets/sample_dataset.zip` folder.
