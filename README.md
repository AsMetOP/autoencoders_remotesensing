# Stacked autoencoder and clustering framework for lithological mapping via remote sensing.

### Repository created for the paper entitled "Stacked autoencoder and clustering framework for lithological mapping via remote sensing" [link to pre-print](https//:)

The notebooks provide the results of applying the k-means clustering method to three different dimensionality-reduced remote sensing datasets. Dimensionality reduction methods used in this study include principal components analysis, canonical autoencoder, and stacked autoencoder and remote sensing datasets include Landsat 8, ASTER, and Sentinel-2.
